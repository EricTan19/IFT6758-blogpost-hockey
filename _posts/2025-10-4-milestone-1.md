## Question 1 - Data Acquisition

To retrieve play-by-play data, simply use the function retrieve_target_year_schedule(target_year). This function will call retrieve_playoffs_games(target_year) and retrieve_regular_season_games(target_year), since each game type has different logic to retrieve the data.

It is important to note that different game types have different logic because the gameId is constructed differently!

### Playoff games
To retrieve the playoffs games data, the function will make a GET api request call to "https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/playoff-series/carousel/{season_id}" to retrieve all of the series letters (numberOfRounds) for a single season. It will then make another GET api request call to "https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/schedule/playoff-series/{season_id}/{i}" which will retrieve all the gameIds/nbOfGames for a certain round (seriesLetter). The play-by-play data will then be retrieved by looping across all the gameIds using retrieve_play_by_play_data(filepath).

### Regular season games
Similarly, to retrieve regular season data, the function will make a GET api request call to "https://api.nhle.com/stats/rest/en/season", which will retrieve all of the seasonIds. We then obtain the number of 'totalRegularSeasonGames' and loop through all of the gameIds using retrieve_play_by_play(filepath) from 1 to #totalRegularSeasonGames.

The retrieve_play_by_play(filepath) function creates folders and json files if they do not exist. It makes a GET api request call to "https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/gamecenter/{game_id}/play-by-play" to retrieve the play-by-play data for a specific gameId obtained from the argument. The play-by-play data is stored in its respective filepath as a .json file.

## Question 2 - Interactive Debugging Tool

This interactive debug tool lets you retrieve downloaded games, filter by year and game type, and inspect specific events. If event coordinates are available, they are shown on the NHL rink along with game score and other details.

### Code
```python

game_type = widgets.Dropdown(options=["playoffs", "regseason"], value="playoffs", description="Game Type: ")
game_id = widgets.Dropdown(options=[], description="Game: ")
